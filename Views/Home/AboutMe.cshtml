    Hi, I’m <strong>Idir</strong> - a curious and adaptable Software Developer. I thrive on solving problems and turning ideas into practical, modern applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started my journey with <strong>Python (Django & Flask)</strong> and grew into into a confident <strong>C# developer</strong>, where I now apply my skills with <strong>ASP.NET Core 9</strong> - working with MVC, RESTful APIs, Razor Pages, Blazor, and Entity Framework.
    On the front end, I enjoy building intuitive interfaces with Vue.js.
  </p>

  <p>
    What motivates me most is combining creativity and logic to improve user experiences and design systems that work seamlessly. I love learning, whether it’s exploring a new framework, refining clean code practices, or collaborating with others to bring projects to life.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-4">
    Outside of coding, I’m a family person who enjoys spending time with my wife and kids. I like going for walks, bike rides, and traveling - experiences that refresh me and often inspire new ideas. Being multilingual (<strong>English, French, Arabic, and Tamazight</strong> (native) - and I’ve achieved <strong>B1 German</strong> since relocating to Germany) also helps me connect easily with different people and cultures.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m dedicated, curious, and love working in collaborative environments - whether that means improving user experiences, architecting backend systems, or picking up new technologies like <strong>React</strong> or <strong>Angular</strong> as needed.
